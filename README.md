# Week-2---Portfolio

Expected Behavior
- 3 Links to the 3 divs of the page were made 
- Title, recent picture and small about me section 
- As no applications have previously been made, placeholders were used in the previous works section
- 1st picture is 500px x 200px while the other 2 are 200px x 200px
- 1 application is on 1 row and the other 2 are positioned underneath it on the next row
- In the Contact me section there are 3 logos for 3 means of Contact

Obstacles faced 
- The linkedin link would not load my linkedin profile, while the other 2 links worked 
- Still need to figure out how to make a header with a horizontal <ul> as it was not working when I copied previous classwork code for it 
- Couldn't position the last 2 placeholders next to each other because their headers would stop working
